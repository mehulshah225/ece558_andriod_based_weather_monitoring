ECE 558 Project #2 -- Build a internet-connected device using MQTT

Although ECE 558 is entitled Embedded Systems Programming all we have produced so far has been software running on an Android device or the Kotlin console. 
Thatâ€™s about to change. Project 2 has significant hardware and software components to it and provides a chance for you to gain experience building an application for the Internet of Things (IoT). 
I will be using a Raspberry PI 3, 3B or 4 (RPi) or an Adafruit Huzzah32 to host your MQTT clients, a low cost temperature sensor (ex: Adafruit AHT20 breakout board) and some discrete components and jumper wires to add an LED and pushbutton to the mix. 

I will use your Android device to run an app that uses MQTT to exchange commands and responses with an MQTT client running on the RPi or Huzzah32. 
The Android app should be programmed in Kotlin and we suggest using Python for the MQTT clients. 
If you are using the Huzzah32 consider using the Arduino support for the board and an MQTT C++ client (there are several). 
Your MQTT broker can be a public cloud-based MQTT broker like the HiveMQ public broker (broker.hivemq.com/1883. If you are running your client on the RPI instead of the Huzzah32 you can start a Mosquitto broker service on the RPi.
